# Edge-Detection
Edge detection is carried out on images using Sobel, Marr-Hildreth and Canny techniques.

This project includes implementation of Sobel, canny and Marr-Hildreth edge detection techniques in both MATLAB and in python. The implementations in MATLAB are written without using any inbuilt image processing functions. For each operation the function is implemented from scratch. Pyhton implementation includes use of Open CV image processing package.

The PDF file includes detailed report on the project and the results obtained.
